    "changelog": "### Changed\n\n* In an effort to no longer require the `IAspect`-based workflow for the character controller, all character update steps, constants, utility methods, etc... were moved out of the `KinematicCharacterAspect` and into `KinematicCharacterUtilities`.\n* All `KinematicCharacterAspect` methods now internally just call their `KinematicCharacterUtilities` counterpart.\n* Refactored some names to adhere to Unity coding standards."
